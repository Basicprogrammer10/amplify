Although the whole crew is now entertained with tic-tac-toe, you need something more interesting to do.
After a bit of thinking you have decided to take up web development!
To start you need a simple HTML tag verifier.

Your program will be supplied with some arguments, each being a sequence of opening and closing HTML tags.
Just like this: `<ol><ol><sub></sub></ol> <li><h5></h5></li>`.
Your program should print `true` or `false` depending on if the tag sequence is valid.\
It is valid if the tags are nested correctly and the tags are closed properly.

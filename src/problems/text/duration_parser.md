wow this trip to the _land of fractals_ really is taking a long time.
You decide to wander around the sub, and you find a screen on a control panel that is labeled “ETA”.
It encodes the time in a string where it gives you a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
As a programmer you prefer to work with time in seconds, so you decide to make a program to decode it.

Here is an example ETA: `112dys492h355mins856s`.
For each argument print the number of seconds it represents.
Each of the time units can be encoded in any of the following ways:

- Days: ["d", "dy", "day"]
- Hours: ["h", "hr", "hour"]
- Minutes: ["m", "min", "minute"]
- Seconds: ["s", "sec", "second"]

As always, example inputs and outputs [here](https://paste.connorcode.com/b/1834222b-bdcd-4574-b8e8-1f57597e11ed).

We are getting very close the end of the year!!!
I don't know how to connect this part with the last one so,,, onto the next problem.

Your program will take in an array of tuples that will contain a 2d bool array and a number.
The number is the number of steps to simulate.
In the bool arrays X is true and \_ is false.
It is your job to simulate the board using the 3 rules of [Conway game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell

Print the final state after the set ammount of simulation steps in the same format of 2d array with the X and \_.
Example input and output [here](https://paste.connorcode.com/b/8596b85b-fbc0-4670-947d-523c86ce4482).

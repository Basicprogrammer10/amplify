Your navagation has been going great so far.
But the sub is going to the _land of fractals_,,, for reason.
The entrance of this place is a giant [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).
In order to safely get in, the captain needs a printout of a Sierpiński triangle.

This problem has one input and it's the order of Sierpiński triangle you must print (ranges from 4-6).
Just print out the Sierpiński triangle with the specified order using this char (`▲`).
There should be no trailing spaces on each line.

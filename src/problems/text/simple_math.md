First off, Welcome to _amplify_!

Let's start with some basic info that will apply to every problem this year.

- You write your code in the text box provided below, pick the language you want to use then press run or use `CTRL + ENTER`
- The code is build and run in the server in a docker container and its STDOUT is compared to the correct output
- The tests are supplied to your program as command line arguments separated by a space
- This is the first time ive done anything like this so if you run into any issues you can file an issue on github [here](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/amplify/issues)

So now that we got that out of the way on to problem #0

Each argument supplied to your program is a simple math expression consisting of only Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication.
Every number will be 3 digits long (100-999) so every test in the following format <code>###(+|-|\*)###</code>.
Print the output of each expression on a new line.

<p>onto problem 3,,, cool beans.</p>
<p>It’s been a day since you’ve been hired for the submarine and you still haven’t been fired!
That’s gotta be a new personal best.
After your excellent work decoding the eccentric captain’s messages you have promoted to Navigation.
In this new position you will be decoding the depths on the maps.</p>
<p>Now this could be a super easy job but remember the whole crazy captain thing.
Each depth is notated through a square brackets where the depth in hundreds of feet is the maximum depth of the brackets.
For example <code>{}{}{}{{}}</code>, the max depth would be 2 (200 feet).
For each bracket sequence just print out the depth in hundreds of feet.</p>

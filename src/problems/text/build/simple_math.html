<p>First off, Welcome to <em>amplify</em>!</p>
<p>Letâ€™s start with some basic info that will apply to every problem this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>You write your code in the text box provided below, pick the language you want to use then press run or use <code>CTRL + ENTER</code></li>
<li>The code is build and run in the server in a docker container and its STDOUT is compared to the correct output</li>
<li>The tests are supplied to your program as command line arguments separated by a space</li>
<li>This is the first time ive done anything like this so if you run into any issues you can file an issue on github <a href="https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/amplify/issues">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So now that we got that out of the way on to problem #0</p>
<p>Each argument supplied to your program is a simple math expression consisting of only Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication.
Every number will be 3 digits long (100-999) so every test in the following format <code>###(+|-|*)###</code>.
Print the output of each expression on a new line.

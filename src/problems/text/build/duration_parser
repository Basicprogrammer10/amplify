<p>wow this trip to the <em>land of fractals</em> really is taking a long time.
You decide to wander around the sub, and you find a screen on a control panel that is labeled “ETA”.
It encodes the time in a string where it gives you a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
As a programmer you prefer to work with time in seconds, so you decide to make a program to decode it.</p>
<p>Here is an example ETA: <code>112dys492h355mins856s</code>.
For each argument print the number of seconds it represents.
Each of the time units can be encoded in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Days: [“d”, “dy”, “day”]</li>
<li>Hours: [“h”, “hr”, “hour”]</li>
<li>Minutes: [“m”, “min”, “minute”]</li>
<li>Seconds: [“s”, “sec”, “second”]</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, example inputs and outputs <a href="https://paste.connorcode.com/b/e4fec8b4-024b-4fdf-9ad4-8f92d304765f">here</a>.</p>

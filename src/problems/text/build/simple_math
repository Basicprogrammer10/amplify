<p>First off, Welcome to <em>amplify</em>!</p>
<p>Let’s start with some basic info that will apply to every problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>You write your code in the text box provided below, pick the language you want to use then press run or use <code>CTRL + ENTER</code></li>
<li>Make sure you press run to save your code changing the language or your progress will be deleted, yes i could fix this, no im not going to</li>
<li>The code is build and run in the server in a docker container and its STDOUT is compared to the correct output</li>
<li>The tests are supplied to your program as command line arguments separated by a space</li>
<li>This is the first time I’ve done anything like this so if you run into any issues you can file an issue on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/amplify/issues">here</a></li>
<li>These problems will start simple but get a bit more complicated as time goes on</li>
</ul>
<p>So now that we got that out of the way on to problem[0]</p>
<p>As an aspiring elementary school teacher you have to check lots of students math homework.
Fortunately most of them <em>don’t do homework</em> so you only have to grade 10 problems.
Being the programmer you are you see an opportunity to make a program that will grade the homework for you that will ultimately take 4 times more time than just grading them normally.</p>
<p>Each argument supplied to your program is a simple math expression consisting of two numbers that are either added, subtracted or multiplied with each other.
Every number will be 3 digits long (100-999) so every test in the following format <code>###(+|-|*)###</code>.
Print the output of each expression on a new line.

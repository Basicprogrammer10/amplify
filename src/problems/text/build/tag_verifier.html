<p>Although the whole crew is now entertained with tic-tac-toe, you need something more interesting to do.
After a bit of thinking you have decided to take up web development!
To start you need a simple HTML tag verifier.</p>
<p>Your program will be supplied with some arguments, each being a sequence of opening and closing HTML tags.
Just like this: <code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>.
Your program should print <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on if the tag sequence is valid.<br />
It is valid if the tags are nested correctly and the tags are closed properly.

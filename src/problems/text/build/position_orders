<p>go go mango!!! its day 4.</p>
<p>Nobody could have seen this coming but every stock you invested in crashed.
<em>i told you not to take financial advice from TikTok<sup>TM</sup></em>.
You check your LinkedIn Profile to see if you have any new job opportunities.
And it turns out you do: you are going to get a job at a submarine company!</p>
<p>So uh you are now the pilot of a submarine and you take orders for moving the submarine.
Unfortunately the captain likes to overcomplicate things and gives you the new sub coordinates through a series of orders.
These orders are comma separates lists of the words “up”, “down”, “left” and “right”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Up increments the X coordinate</li>
<li>Down decrements the X coordinate</li>
<li>Right increments the Y coordinate</li>
<li>Left decrements the Y coordinate</li>
</ul>
<p>For each argument print out the new coordinates of the submarine in the following format: <code>(X,Y)</code>.
Also, the coordinates always start at 0,0.
As always an example Input and Output are <a href="https://paste.connorcode.com/b/84c882d7-e96a-4d06-9a04-5d96b67f2644">here</a>.
oh and also the third dimension has disappeared, a search team has been sent out but it’s not looking promising.</p>

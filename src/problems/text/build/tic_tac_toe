<p>The journey to the <em>land of fractals</em> is taking a long time.
You and your fellow crew mates have started playing tic-tac-toe to pass the time.
The only problem is that nobody else knows how the game works and don’t know when someone has won.
In the beginning you just looked at the game to see if someone has won but now more and more people are starting to play and you can’t keep up!
You decide to write a program to help you out.</p>
<p>This program will take an array of boards as an input and you will have to print out an array showing if someone has won horizontally (H), vertically (V), diagonally (D), or not at all (_).
The input looks a little something like this: <code>[[XX_,_XX,_XX],[OOX,X_O,X_X]...</code>.
As you can see it’s each board is a list of three strings of length 3.
X means that there is an x there, O means that there is an o there and _ means that there is no peice there.
The output for the input shown above is this: <code>[V,_,...</code>.
A full example will explain this whole thing bettor so make sure to check out an example Input and Output <a href="https://paste.connorcode.com/b/8e50279f-fe67-40e6-9f66-3836054ceb5c">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once Jeremiah leaves, you unlock and open the door again.
You look inside and see a metal box.
You reach in and grab it, it contains a signal sheet of paper.
You start reading it but just at that moment the captain of the sub comes walking down the hallway and sees you.
They have a <em>little talk</em> and they end up fireing you for <em>know too much</em>.
Since you can’t really get off the sub the captain gives you some busywork.</p>
<p>They task with simulating 50 steps of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30">Rule 30 cellular automaton</a>.
In this cellular automaton you have a 1D array of cells, each with the possible state of alive or dead.
Starting with cell #50 being alive, your program should print and simulate the next 49 steps.
The simulation is governed by these simple rules:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">111</th>
<th align="center">110</th>
<th align="center">101</th>
<th align="center">100</th>
<th align="center">011</th>
<th align="center">010</th>
<th align="center">001</th>
<th align="center">000</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This can also be expressed at the following boolean expression: <code>left_cell ^ (central_cell || right_cell)</code>.
Honestly Wikipedia explains this much bettor so just check that.
When printing the world use a space for dead and <code>█</code> for live also make sure to trim the extra spaces at the end of each line.

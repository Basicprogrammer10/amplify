<p>After you put in all the numbers from your program.
The keypad flashes green and beeps, the door swings open.
Right as you are about to open it all the way, a crewmate, Jeremiah, walks by and you shut the door.
They ask you about how much longer until we get to the next prime number.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the next challenge.
Write a program that takes in a number of seconds and rounds the output to the best unit.
The best unit is the biggest unit that can represent the time without going into fractions of 1.
The units are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seconds</li>
<li>Minutes</li>
<li>Hours</li>
<li>Days</li>
<li>Weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program output should be in the following format: <code># unit(s)</code>.
Remember to add that s if the number is more than 1.

<p>We are getting very close the end of the year!!!
I donâ€™t know how to connect this part with the last one so,,, onto the next problem.</p>
<p>Your program will take in an array of tuples that will contain a 2d bool array and a number.
The number is the number of steps to simulate.
In the bool arrays X is true and _ is false.
It is your job to simulate the board using the 3 rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway game of life</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Print the final state after the set ammount of simulation steps in the same format of 2d array with the X and _.
Example input and output <a href="https://paste.connorcode.com/b/3c4bd80a-d8b0-4ebf-90ce-0e9bd92b7e9c">here</a>.</p>

But the sub is going to the <em>land of fractals</em>,,, for reason.
The entrance of this place is a giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpiński triangle</a>.
In order to safely get in, the captain needs a printout of a Sierpiński triangle.</p>
<p>This problem has one input and it’s the order of Sierpiński triangle you must print (ranges from 4-6).
Just print out the Sierpiński triangle with the specified order using this char (<code>▲</code>).
There should be no trailing spaces on each line.
